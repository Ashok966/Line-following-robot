# Line Following Robot

## Introduction

The Line Following Robot is a project that demonstrates a robot's ability to autonomously follow a predefined path or line on the ground using sensors and automation. This README file provides an overview of the project, its components, and instructions on how to set it up and use it.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with your Line Following Robot project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of electronics and programming.
- A compatible microcontroller board (Arduino).
- Infrared sensors for line detection.
- Motors and wheels for robot movement.
- Battery or power supply for the robot.

## Components

### Hardware Components

- Microcontroller board (Arduino Uno)
- Infrared sensors
- Motor driver
- Motors and wheels
- Chassis
- Battery or power supply
- Jumper wires
- Screwdriver and other basic tools

## Assembly

1. Chassis Assembly: Assemble the robot's chassis, following the manufacturer's instructions. Attach the motors and wheels securely.

2. Sensor Placement: Mount the line detection sensors on the robot's front, close to the ground, and aligned with the expected line path.

3. Microcontroller Setup: Connect the sensors and motors to your microcontroller board. Verify the wiring and connections are correct.

4. Power Supply: Connect the power supply to the microcontroller and motors. Ensure it meets the voltage and current requirements.

5. Upload Code: Upload the line following algorithm or code to your microcontroller board. Be sure to calibrate the sensors if necessary.

6. Test and Adjust: Place the robot on the line path and test its functionality. If it doesn't follow the line correctly, make any necessary adjustments in the code or sensor positioning.

## Software Setup

Provide instructions on how to set up the required software for the Line Following Robot, including code libraries and any specific IDE (Integrated Development Environment) recommendations.

## Usage

1. Power on the robot.
2. Place it on the line or path you want it to follow.
3. The robot should start following the line autonomously.
4. Monitor the robot's behavior and make adjustments as needed.

## Troubleshooting

List common issues and their solutions, such as sensor calibration problems, code errors, or motor issues.
